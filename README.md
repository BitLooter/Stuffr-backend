## Stuffr

Stuffr is a web-based appplication to manage your *things*. It makes it easy to manage a database of items and all their related data - keep track of receipts, photos, purchase dates, serial numbers, any sort of information you might need.

### Backend server

This repository contains the backend code needed to get Stuffr to work. It mostly manages the database and provides a REST frontend to access it.
